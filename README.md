# hello-world
First repository to start learning Github.
I am finishing up my PhD training in pharmacology and I'm ready to start transitioning into a career in data science to apply my knowledge of science to the pharmaceutical industry and ultimately help as many lives as possible. 
In my free time I love to play a variety of sports like swimming, tennis, and volleyball.
